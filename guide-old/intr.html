<h2><a id="chap1">Chapter 1. Introduction</a></h2>

<h3 style="color:blue;">A. Origin and Purposes of the Guide</h3>
<p>The purposes and spirit of this short version are the same as those of the second edition of the Guide: to promote international agreement on principles of stratigraphic classification and to develop an internationally acceptable stratigraphic terminology and rules of stratigraphic procedure-all in the interest of improved accuracy and precision in international communication, coordination, and understanding.</p>

<h3 style="color:blue;">B. Composition of Subcommission</h3>
<p> The membership of the Subcommission represents a worldwide geographic spread of stratigraphers and stratigraphic organizations and a wide spectrum of stratigraphic interests, traditions and philosophies.</p>
<p>Over the years, the number of members has ranged from 75 to 130 representing 30 to 45 countries.</p>

<h3 style="color:blue;">C. Preparation and Revision of the Guide</h3>

<h3 style="color:blue;">D. Spirit of the Guide</h3>
<p>Like the second edition of the International Stratigraphic Guide, this abridged version is offered as a recommended approach to stratigraphic classification, terminology, and procedure, not as a &quot;code&quot;.</p>

<h3 style="color:blue;">E. National and Regional Stratigraphic Codes</h3>
<p>The ISSC has always supported the development of national and regional stratigraphic codes; these codes have helped in the past in developing principles, and providing a testing ground for various proposals contained in the Guide.</p>
