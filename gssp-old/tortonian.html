<h3><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:blue'>GSSP
for Tortonian Stage</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
color:red'>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 style="color:red;">Definition:</h4>

<p style="color:red;">The base of the Tortonian
Stage is defined as the mid-point of the sapropel layer of basic cycle number
76 in the Monte dei Corvi Beach section, located on the Adriatic coast of
central Italy, 5km SE of Ancona. This level has been assigned an astronomical
age of 11.608 Ma. It coincides almost exactly with the Last Common Occurrences
of the calcareous nannofossil <i>Discoaster kugleri</i> and the planktonic
foraminifer <i>Globigerinoides subquadratus</i>, and is associated with the
short normal-polarity subchron C5r.2n. This level coincides closely with oxygen
isotope event Mi-5 and the associated glacio-eustatic sea-level low-stand of
supercycle T3.1 and concurrent deep-sea hiatus NH4.</p>

  <h4>Location:</h4>
  <p>The
  Monte dei Corvi Beach section is exposed in the coastal cliffs of Monte dei
  Corvi located 5km SE of Ancona (Italy) at a latitude of 43°35'12&quot; North,
  and a longitude of 13°34'10&quot; East. The section can be reached via the
  trail that starts at La Sardella some 100m east of Monte dei Corvi.</p>

  <h4>Sedimentology:</h4>
  <p>The
  Serravallian and lower Tortonian is exposed along the eastern slopes and in
  the coastal cliffs of Monte dei Corvi. This section contains the upper part
  of the marly Schlier Formation and consists of a cyclic alternation of
  greenish-grey marls, whitish marly limestones and brown colored organic-rich
  layers (sapropel). In addition two biotite-rich volcanic ash layers, named
  Respighi and Ancona, are present.<br>
  The depositional environment remained (hemi)pelagic throughout the
  succession. Bottom water conditions changed cyclically between oxic (marls)
  and anoxic or dysoxic (sapropel layers).</p>

<h4>Primary Markers:</h4>

<p>The Monte dei Corvi Beach section is
composed of a cyclic alternation of marls, marly limestones and organic-rich beds
(Montanari et al., 1997). The basic small-scale cycle is a couplet (between 0.3
and 1.0 m thick) which consists of an indurated whitish marly limestone and a
softer grey to greenish-grey marl. Brownish to blackish colored organic-rich
beds termed sapropels are frequently but not always intercalated in the
limestones. <br>
Larger-scale cycles can be distinguished in addition and comprise both
small-scale and large-scale sapropel clusters. Small-scale clusters contain 2
to 4 sapropels (and 5-6 basic cycles); large-scale clusters contain several
small-scale clusters (and up to 20 basic cycles). Finally a cycle of
intermediate-scale is recognized by repetitive sapropel patterns in every other
basic cycle. Previous studies of marine sections of Late Miocene to Pleistocene
age in the Mediterranean (Hilgen, 1991; Hilgen et al., 1995; Lourens et al.,
1996) showed that similar sapropel patterns reflect the astronomical cycles of
precession (basic cycle), obliquity (intermediate cycle) and eccentricity
(larger-scale cycles). Using the same phase relations as established for the
younger sapropels, the sedimentary cycles in the Monte dei Corvi Beach section
were tuned to the precession and insolation time series of the La93 solution
(Laskar, 1990; Laskar et al., 1993). This tuning provides astronomical ages for
all the sedimentary cycles, calcareous plankton bioevents, magnetic reversals
and ash beds recorded in the section. It shows that the entire beach section
ranges from 13.4 to 8.5 Ma and that the Tortonian GSSP has an astronomical age
of 11.608 Ma (Hilgen et al., 2003).</p>

<h4>Secondary
Markers:</h4>

<p><b>Foraminifera:</b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'><br>
The GSSP is close to the Last Common Occurrence of <i>Globigerinoides
subquadratus</i>. The GSSP falls within the <i>Paragloborotalia siakensis</i>
Zone of Iaccarino (1985).<br>
<b>Nannoplankton:</b><br>
The GSSP closely coincides with the Last Common Occurrence of <i>Discoaster
kugleri</i>. <br>
<b>Paleomagnetics:</b><br>
The GSSP is closely associated with the base of the short normal subchron
C5r.2n.</p>

<h4>Correlation
Events:</h4>

<p>Calcareous nannofossil last common occurrence
of <i>Discoaster kugleri</i></p>

<h4>Other Locations
around the World:</h4>

<p>An auxiliary boundary stratotype
section was designated along the southern slopes of Monte Gibliscemi, Sicily
(Italy). This section has been correlated bed by bed to the Monte dei Corvi section.
The Last Common Occurrence of <i>Discoaster kugleri</i> and <i>Globigerinoides
subquadratus</i> appear to be synchronous between the Mediterranean and the
low-latitude open ocean. The GSSP further coincides almost exactly with the
Barstovian-Clarendonian Mammal Age boundary in North America.</p>
