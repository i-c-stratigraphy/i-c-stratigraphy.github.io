<h4 style="color:red;">Definition:</h4>

<p style="color:red;">The base of the Middle
Ordovician Series and Dapingian is defined at a point 10.57m above the base of
the Dawan Formation at the base of Bed SHOD-16 in the Huanghuachang Section,
22km NE of Yichang City, Hubei Province, South China. It coincides with the
first appearance datum of the conodont <i>Baltoniodus triangularis</i>. It is
associated with the FAD of conodont <i>Periodon</i> sp. A and followed closely
by the FAD of conodont <i>Microzarkina flabellum</i>. This level nearly coincides
with the base of the <i>Belonechitina</i> cf. <i>henryi</i> chitinozoan
biozone.</p>

  <h4>Location:</h4>
  <p>The
  Huanghuachang Section is located along the major road from Yichang City to
  Xinshan County, 22km NE of Yichang City, Hubei Province, China. The section
  is well exposed at the center of the Ordovician Geopark, which is part of the
  National Geopark of the Yangtze Gorges. The section is located at a latitude
  of 30°51’ 37.8&quot;N and a longitude of 110°22’ 26.5&quot;E. It is 10.57 m
  above the base of the Dawan Formation (base of Bed SHod-16).</p>

  <h4>Sedimentology:</h4>
  <p>The
  Huanghuachang Section comprises mainly the Dawan Formation. The Dawan
  Formation is subdivided into three units. The Lower Member is 12.97m thick
  and composed of gray, thin-bedded and minor medium-bedded limestones,
  bioclastic limestones and glauconitic limestones with yellow-green shale
  interbeds. The GSSP is located at the base of Bed SHOD-16 in the upper part
  of the Lower Member. This is 0.6m above the top of the distinctive 0.9m
  thick, medium-bedded dolomitic micritic limestone (SHOD 9-11) and 10.57m
  above the base of the Dawan Formation. The Middle Member of the Dawan
  Formation is 13 m thick. It is composed of purple medium-bedded micrite with
  yellow-green mudstone and shale interbeds. The Upper Member of the Dawan
  Formation of 28 m thick, it consists of yellow-green shale intercalated with
  thin-bedded nodular limestone and mudstone</p>

<h4>Primary Markers:</h4>

<p><b>Conodonts:</b><br>
The GSSP coincides with the first appearance datum of <i>Baltoniodus
triangularis</i>. It is further associated with the FAD of <i>Periodon</i> sp.
A and followed closely by the FAD of <i>Microzarkina flabellum</i>.</p>

<h4>Secondary
Markers:</h4>

<p><b>Chitinozoans:</b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'><br>
The base of the <i>Belonechitina</i> cf. <i>henryi</i> chitinozoan biozone is
very close to the base of the <i>Baltoniodus triangularis</i></p>

<h4>Correlation
Events:</h4>

<p>Conodont FAD of <i>Baltoniodus
triangularis</i></p>

<h4>Other Locations
around the World:</h4>

<p>The base of the <i>Baltoniodus
triangularis</i> conodont biozone can be easily recognized in the North
Atlantic Realm, North American Midcontinent Realm and in the Baltoscandinavian
Region and northwestern Russia.</p>
