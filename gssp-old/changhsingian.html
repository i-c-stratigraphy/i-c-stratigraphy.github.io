for Changhsingian Stage</h3>

<h4 style="color:red;">Definition:</h4>

<p style="color:red;">The Base of the
Changhsingian Stage is defined at the base of Bed 4a-2, 88 cm above the base of
the Changxing Limestone at the Meishan D Section, just above a flooding surface
marking the second parasequence in the Changxing Limestone. The GSSP coincides
with the FAD of the conodont species <i>Clarkina wangi</i> within the lineage
from <i>Clarkina longicuspidata</i> to <i>Clarkina wangi</i>.</p>

  <h4>Location:</h4>
  <p>The
  section is located at the Meishan Section D, Changxing County, Zhejiang
  Province between Nanjing and Shanghai, China at a latitude of 31°4'55&quot;N
  and a longitude of 119°42'22.9&quot;E and is freely accessible and well
  protected.</p>

  <h4>Sedimentology:</h4>
  <p>The
  exposure at the Meishan D section contains only the uppermost part of the Longtan
  Formation. These beds include earthy yellow, calcareous siltstone and
  mudstone with horizontal beds of increasing thickness that contain ammonoids
  and brachiopods. This bed appears to be conformable with the overlying
  Baoqing Member of the Changxing Limestone.<br>
  The lowest bed (Bed 2) of the Changxing Limestone at section D, which is
  represented by dark grey, thick-bedded silty wackestone, appears to form the
  upper part of a cycle or parasequence.<br>
  Bed 3 contains greyish black calcareous mudstone and thin-bedded argillaceous
  mudstone that may represent the flooding unit of a second parasequence in the
  section.<br>
  Beds 4 and 5 include thin to medium bedded wackestone and represent the
  regressive portion of this second parasequence.</p>

<h4>Primary Markers:</h4>

<p>The base of the Changhsingian Stage is
defined at the FAD of the conodont species <i>Clarkina wangi</i> within the
lineage from <i>Clarkina longicuspidata</i> to <i>Clarkina wangi</i> at the
base of Bed 4a-2</p>

<h4>Secondary
Markers:</h4>

<p><b>Ammonites</b><br>
The ammonoid <i>Sinoceltites</i> has its first occurrence in the same bed as <i>Clarkina
wangi</i>. The first occurrence of the ammonoid <i>Tapashanites</i> is only 42
cm above the GSSP.<br>
<b>Fusulinaceans</b><br>
<i>Palaeofusulina</i> aff. <i>sinensis</i> has its first appearance together
with <i>Clarkina wangi</i> in Bed 4a-2.</p>

<h4>Correlation
Events:</h4>

<p>Conodont FAD <i>Clarkina wangi</i></p>

<h4>Notes on
Derivation of Age:</h4>

<p>Permian-Carboniferous time scale is
derived from calibrating a master composite section to selected radiometric
ages <br>
