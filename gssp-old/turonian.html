<h3><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:blue'>GSSP
for Turonian Stage</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";

<h4 style="color:red;">Definition:</h4>

<p style="color:red;">The base of the Turonian
Stage is defined as the base of Bed 86 of the Bridge Creek Limestone Member at
the western end of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad cut near the
north boundary of the Pueblo Reservoir State Recreation Area, west of Pueblo,
Colorado, USA. The GSSP coincides with the first occurrence of the ammonite <i>Watinoceras
devonense</i>, is in the middle of a global positive excursion in carbon 13
isotopes, and is bracketed by widespread bentonites that have yielded an age of
93 to 93.5 Ma.</p>

  <h4>Location:</h4>
  <p>The
  GSSP is located at the western end of the Denver and Rio Grande Western
  Railroad cut near the north boundary of the Pueblo Reservoir State Recreation
  Area, west of Pueblo, Colorado, where the Arkansas River cuts through the
  Rock Canyon anticline at a latitude of 38°16'56&quot;N and 104°43'39&quot;W
  (the latitude and longitude are from Google Earth, because the Lat/Long
  values in the published paper are rounded to the nearest degree.)</p>

  <h4>Sedimentology:</h4>
  <p>The
  Cenomanian - Turonian Boundary lies in the Bridge Creek Limestone Member of
  the Greenhorn Limestone Formation. The section consists of about 17m of hard,
  grey, shaly weathering limestones, interbedded with soft calcareous shale and
  bentonites. The GSSP is located at the base of Bed 86.</p>

<h4>Primary Markers:</h4>

<p>The GSSP coincides with the first
appearance of the ammonite <i>Watinoceras devonense</i>.</p>

<h4>Secondary
Markers:</h4>

<p><b>Foraminifera:</b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'><br>
<i>Helvetoglobotruncana helvetica</i> appears for the first time in Bed 89.<br>
<b>Nannoplankton:</b><br>
The last occurrence of <i>Microstaurus chiastius</i> is between Beds 85 and 88.<br>
<b>Bivalves:</b><br>
The first occurrence of <i>Mytiloides hattini</i> is in the topmost part of Bed
84. The first occurrence of <i>Mytiloides puebloensis</i> coincides with the
GSSP in Bed 86.<br>
<b>Stable Isotopes:</b><br>
The δ<sup>13</sup>Corg (PDB) curve shows that the base of Bed 86 falls
immediately below the third positive peak in the curve. <br>
<b>Radioisotopic Dating:</b><br>
Widespread bentonites from other sections which can be correlated to Pueblo
have yielded an age of 93 to 93.5 Ma for the boundary.</p>
