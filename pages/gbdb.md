The Geobiodiversity Database (GBDB) is the formal database of the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS).  First established in In 2012, it is based at the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology (NIGP).  The project and its website are directed by Dr Hong-He Xu.  The new website of GBDB was launched on 27.5.20 at <http://geobiodiversity.com/>.
 
Since 2019, the GBDB, supported by technician Mr. Chen Yan-Sen, surveyed the usage and collected feedback from the users of the GBDB.  This was used as a basis for redesigning and developing both the database and website. The updates and new features of the GBDB version 2.0β include:

1.	The website database was re-designed and optimised to ensure a secure backup mechanism of data has been developed.
2.	Data visualisation has been developed. All data are plotted on the world map on the homepage that also displays the volume of the all data in the upper righthand corner. At the centre of the view is the map of China and the map can be zoomed in or out using mouse scroll. Geological sections are shown as individual spots and their rough or detailed information can be checked easily.
3.	The different colours of spots on the map correspond to various geological stages of the International Chronostratigraphic Chart.  This is displayed in disc-shaped form in the lower righthand corner of the map and it can be manually hidden.
4.	The interactive experience has been enhanced on a friendly interface. The downloading of data has been simplified and optimised. Any visitor can download data but new data can only be added by registered users. The data examination has been developed.
5.	Data retrieval and query have been optimised. One can search and download from the homepage.
6.	The case study and publications based on GBDB data are listed under the ‘Research’ button, which also shows the people and funds concerning the GBDB.
7.	The palaeogeographic map layer has been added, all data can be plotted on it.
8.	The data analysis is reserved for the ongoing work of data analysis and visualisation.
9.	The user system has been optimised, personal profile and favourites can be customised.
10.	The old version of the GBDB is retained and is linked on the homepage.
