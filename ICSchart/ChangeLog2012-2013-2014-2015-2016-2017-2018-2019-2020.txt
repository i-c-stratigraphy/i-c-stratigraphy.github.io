Numeric Ages altered:
2020/03 - Paleogene: numeric age Base Priabonian Stage changed to 37.71 Ma (was 37.8 Ma) - by request of PgSC (Simonetta Monechi), updated to that at the ratified GSSP.

2013 - BASE OF CRETACEOUS, BASE OF CARBONIFERUOUS, BASE OF CAMBRIAN, 
the ages for these three also appear as top of Jurassic, Devonian, Ediacaran in the chart layout.
the ages reported for the top are _exactly_ the same as for the base (e.g. ~ 145.0 for Base Cretaceous, not +-0.1)

SUBSERIES GRAPHIC INDICATION
- Starting 2018/07: Where ratified, these are indicated as thin lines to the right side of the Series column, and small font U/L, M, L/E indicators (see also the Descriptive text change log)
- This differs from the way Subsystems are indicated (the Carboniferous Subsystems since long are incidated as full cells), for graphic reasons mainly.
2020/01  Indication added for Pleistocene Subseries (ratified in parallel to GSSP Chibanian; 15/30-01-2020)
2018/07  Infication added for Holocene Subseries (ratified in parallel to GSSP


TYPE SETTING CHANGES
2019/05 Precambrian font switched to italics, after discussion in Precambrian subcommission, ICS and ICS executive. Also Graphic changes (see below). 
2018/07 Holocene ratified Subseries and Stages: Stage names put in smaller font than others for reason of chart design continuity. Also added U/L, M and L/E to the left of the Series column to indicate ratified Subseries to exist for this Series. 
2016/04 Upper and Middle Pleistocene: capitalized placeholder subseries names in Stages column set in italics rather than regular font

========================

Descriptive text: 
2018/07 - Authorship J.-X. Fan added to authors.
2016/10 - Authorship of version of chart changed: DAT Harper has taken over role of SC Finney in ICS executive board (as per 35th IGC Capetown ICS business-meeting and IUGS assembly)

2019/05 - Sentence added "Italic fonts indicate informal units and placeholders for unnamed units."
2018/07 - Sentence added "Ratified Subseries/Subepochs are abbreviated as U/L (Upper/Late), M (Middle) and L/E (Lower/Early)."

TWO TIMES, IN FIRST PART AND IN SECOND PART of sentence declaring deviations from GTS2012: 
2018/07 - Lower Pleistocene changed into Quaternary: Q, upper Pg, C, T, P, PreC
2017/02 - upper Paleogene ages (ages deviating) added  (2018/07: upper decapitalised)
2016/10 - reordered ammended the ages/subcommissions to be chronological (lower Pl, C, T, P, PreC)
2014/02 - Lower Pleistocene (ages deviating) added
2013 - Permian (ages deviating) added
2012 - Triassic and Cretaceous ones as deviating from 'A Geological Time Scale 2012' communicated status

2014/02 - To cite: Cohen et al. (2013) Episodes reference added.


GRAPHICS
===========
2019/05:
ICS bottom of chart signature moved from base Hadean to base Archean (to better indicate the informal status of Hadean)
2019/03:
Cell widths of 'Precambrian' table column modified.
2019/05:
Header placement above cell columns of 'Precambrian' table column modified. 'Eonothem / Eon',  Erathem / Era and  System / Period headers rotated to 45 degreees as the Phanerozoic table columns. The reason for the change was to remove unclarity, former placement was suggesting that it was the header for the Precambrian cell too (following aforementioned discussion).


2013/2015
- 'Systems' cells of first column slimmed down to match the width in the second and third column
- Vertical and horizontal centering of names in their cells checked and fixed

Adobe-illustrator file (main version layers):
- Background layer (not displayed as visible) contained 'made invisible' logos from 2012 congres and sponsor. These are deleted now.

- Added the deep URL in the lowerright corner of the chart.
- Added a line 'The URL to this chart is found below.' to the first paragraph of the text.
- line spacing of the blank lines set to 7 pt, wheras the main text is in 9 pt font.
- further fiddiling with the exact font size of the text lines to accommodate additions with versions.

Adobe-illustrator file (layers storing translations)
- Since 2019, the master file for the english version of the chart, also holds additional layers with translated versions
- Importing those from separate illustrator files (Graphic Officer archive) and PDFs (translations produced independently Graphic Officer; Chinese and Japanese fonts) is in progress.
- This serves to be able to update translated versions more easily. 
- Some features are: 
--- Toggle numeric ages layer in decimal point notations, numeric ages layer in decimal comma notation,
--- Logo and text space at bottom of chart to feature translating parties.
--- Logo space also used to produce four-annual IGC handout versions of chart.
