2013 - BASE OF CRETACEOUS, BASE OF CARBONIFERUOUS, BASE OF CAMBRIAN, 
the ages for these three also appear as top of Jurassic, Devonian, Ediacaran in the chart layout.
the ages reported for the top are _exactly_ the same as for the base (e.g. ~ 145.0 for Base Cretaceous, not +-0.1)

SUBSERIES GRAPHIC INDICATION
- Starting 2018/07: Where ratified, these are indicated as thin lines to the right side of the Series column, and small font U/L, M, L/E indicators (see also the Descriptive text change log)
- This differs from the way Subsystems are indicated (the Carboniferous Subsystems since long are incidated as full cells), for graphic reasons mainly.
2021/10  Indication added for Neogene (Pliocene, Miocene) Subseries (ratified 12/13-10-2020)
2020/01  Indication added for Pleistocene Subseries (ratified in parallel to GSSP Chibanian; 15/30-01-2020)
2018/07  Indication added for Holocene Subseries (ratified in parallel to GSSP)


TYPE SETTING CHANGES
2019/05 Precambrian font switched to italics, after discussion in Precambrian subcommission, ICS and ICS executive. Also Graphic changes (see below). 
2018/07 Holocene ratified Subseries and Stages: Stage names put in smaller font than others for reason of chart design continuity. Also added U/L, M and L/E to the left of the Series column to indicate ratified Subseries to exist for this Series. 
2016/04 Upper and Middle Pleistocene: capitalized placeholder subseries names in Stages column set in italics rather than regular font

========================

Descriptive text: 
2024/12 - Substantial change and reorganization of the descriptive text. Specific mention of systems deviating from GTS base reference is removed. GTS2012 mention replaced by GTS2020. 
2024/12 - Edited paragraph 1 (includes the line on subseries abbreviation formerly in paragraph 2): 
 Units of all ranks are in the process of being defined by Global Boundary 
 Stratotype Section and Points (GSSP) for their lower boundaries, including 
 those of the Archean and Proterozoic, long defined by Global Standard 
 Stratigraphic Ages (GSSA). Ratified Subseries/Subepochs are abbreviated as 
 U/L (Upper/Late), M (Middle) and L/E (Lower/Early). Italic fonts indicate informal 
 units and placeholders for unnamed units. Previous versions and detailed 
 information on ratified GSSPs are available at the website 
 http://www.stratigraphy.org. The URL to this chart is provided below.

2024/12 - Edited paragraph 2: 
 Numerical ages are subject to ongoing revision and do not define units in the 
 Phanerozoic and the Ediacaran; only GSSPs do. For boundaries in the 
 Phanerozoic without ratified GSSPs or without constrained numerical ages, an 
 approximate numerical age (~) is provided.
2024/12 - Edited paragraph 3:
 Most numerical ages are taken from ‘A Geologic Time Scale 2020’ by Gradstein 
 et al. (2020), but some ages differ as provided by the relevant ICS 
 subcommissions, with advice from the Timescale Calibration subcommission. 
 These are approved by the ICS executive as the current consensus. 

2024/12 - Edited Credits and (c) lines:
 Chart drafted and maintained online by officers K.M. Cohen and N. Car. 
 The chart is a product of collective work by all ICS members past and present.
 (c) International Commission on Stratigraphy, Month YYYY

2021/07 - Authorship of version of chart changed: N Car has taken over role of J.-X. Fan in 2020.
2018/07 - Authorship J.-X. Fan added to authors.
2016/10 - Authorship of version of chart changed: DAT Harper has taken over role of SC Finney in ICS executive board (as per 35th IGC Capetown ICS business-meeting and IUGS assembly)

2019/05 - Sentence added "Italic fonts indicate informal units and placeholders for unnamed units."
2018/07 - Sentence added "Ratified Subseries/Subepochs are abbreviated as U/L (Upper/Late), M (Middle) and L/E (Lower/Early)."

TWO TIMES, IN FIRST PART AND IN SECOND PART of sentence declaring deviations from GTS2012: 
2022/02 - Cambrian ages (base Cambrian) added
2018/07 - Lower Pleistocene changed into Quaternary: Q, upper Pg, C, T, P, PreC
2017/02 - upper Paleogene ages (ages deviating) added  (2018/07: upper decapitalised)
2016/10 - reordered ammended the ages/subcommissions to be chronological (lower Pl, C, T, P, PreC)
2014/02 - Lower Pleistocene (ages deviating) added
2013 - Permian (ages deviating) added
2012 - Triassic and Cretaceous ones as deviating from 'A Geological Time Scale 2012' communicated status

2014/02 - To cite: Cohen et al. (2013) Episodes reference added.


GRAPHICS
===========
2024/12
- Logo of CGMW/CCGM updated in lower right corner

2023/04:
Cell thickness of Lower Cretaceous Aptian (thinner), Barremian (thinner), Hauteverian (thicker) and Valanginian (thicker) stages adapted 
    Now visually compliant again to numeric age revisions (thickness was based on 2012 numeric age, thickness now is based on 2023 numeric ages)
2022/10:
ICS bottom of chart signature at base Archean moved back to base Hadean (to indicate the now formalised status of the Hadean with the ratified GSSA). 
2021/07:
Stratigraphic colour for Pennsylvanian ammended (to contrast it to Bashkirian better), in collaboration with CCGM/CGMW (Bruno Vrielynck). 
2021/05:
Stratigraphic colour for Late Pleistocene and Holocene ammended, in collaboration with CCGM/CGMW. Cf. Table 2 in Head et al. (2020, Episodes).
2019/05:
ICS bottom of chart signature moved from base Hadean to base Archean (to better indicate the informal status of Hadean)
2019/03:
Cell widths of 'Precambrian' table column modified.
2019/05:
Header placement above cell columns of 'Precambrian' table column modified. 'Eonothem / Eon',  Erathem / Era and  System / Period headers rotated to 45 degreees as the Phanerozoic table columns. The reason for the change was to remove unclarity, former placement was suggesting that it was the header for the Precambrian cell too (following aforementioned discussion).


2013/2015
- 'Systems' cells of first column slimmed down to match the width in the second and third column
- Vertical and horizontal centering of names in their cells checked and fixed

Adobe-illustrator file (main version layers):
- Background layer (not displayed as visible) contained 'made invisible' logos from 2012 congres and sponsor. These are deleted now.

- Added the deep URL in the lowerright corner of the chart.
- Added a line 'The URL to this chart is found below.' to the first paragraph of the text.
- line spacing of the blank lines set to 7 pt, wheras the main text is in 9 pt font.
- further fiddiling with the exact font size of the text lines to accommodate additions with versions.

Adobe-illustrator file (layers storing translations)
- Since 2019, the master file for the english version of the chart, also holds additional layers with translated versions
- Importing those from separate illustrator files (Graphic Officer archive) and PDFs (translations produced independently Graphic Officer; Chinese and Japanese fonts) is in progress.
- This serves to be able to update translated versions more easily. 
- Some features are: 
--- Toggle numeric ages layer in decimal point notations, numeric ages layer in decimal comma notation,
--- Logo and text space at bottom of chart to feature translating parties.
--- Logo space also used to produce four-annual IGC handout versions of chart.

Per 2023/10 the following translations have been imported in the master file (next to English):
-- Finnish, Hungarian, Norwegian, Dutch (NL,B), Slovak, Czech, German, French [with decimal comma]; 
-- Turkish, Brazilian Portuguese, Iberian Portuguese, American Spanish, Spanish, Catalan, Chinese, Japanese, Korean [with decimal point].
-- At GBDB in China, a Chinese masterfile translated chart is kept, parallel to ICS.

As per 2022/02-2023/10 older translations still awaiting import are:
-- Russian, Lithuanian, Basque
