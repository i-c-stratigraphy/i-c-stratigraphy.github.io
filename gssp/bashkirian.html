<h3><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:blue'>GSSP
for Bashkirian Stage</h3>

<h4 style="color:red;">Definition:</h4>

<p style="color:red;">The base of the
Pennsylvanian Sub-System (Upper Carboniferous) and Bashkirian Stage is located
at Arrow Canyon near Las Vegas, Nevada, in the arid Basin and Range Province of
the southwestern USA. The GSSP is located at 82.9m above the top of the
Battleship Formation in the lower Bird Spring Formation at the evolutionary
first appearance of the conodont <i>Declinognathodus noduliferus</i> s.l. The
GSSP coincides exactly with the historically stable Mississippian-Pennsylvanian
boundary.</p>

  <h4>Location:</h4>
  <p>The
  Mid-Carboniferous Boundary is located at Arrow Canyon in the southwestern
  United States approximately 75km NE of Las Vegas, Nevada, on land
  administered and protected by the Federal Government. It is readily accessible
  by a 4-wheel drive road that runs along Arrow Canyon and is connected to
  Highway 168 by a paved secondary road.</p>

  <h4>Sedimentology:</h4>
  <p>During
  the Carboniferous Arrow Canyon was situated near the paleo-equator in a
  tropical to subtropical seaway extending from SE California through western
  Canada to Alaska.<br>
  The Birdspring Formation comprises limestone with subordinate mudstone,
  sandstone and dolostone. The boundary limestone from 6.95m to 8.1m comprises
  grainstone and packstone dominated by pelmatozoans, brachiopods and
  bryozoans; above 8.1m brachiopod packstone to wackestone is predominant.<br>
  The Mid-Carboniferous Boundary is at 7.63m.<br>
  The succession containing the boundary interval comprises numerous high-order
  transgressive-regressive (TR) sequences that resulted mainly from
  glacio-eustatic fluctuations driven by ongoing glaciations in Gondwana.</p>

<h4>Primary Markers:</h4>

<p>The Bashkirian GSSP coincides with the
evolutionary first appearance of the conodont <i>Declinognathodus noduliferus</i>
s.l.</p>

<h4>Secondary
Markers:</h4>

<p><b>Brachiopods:</b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'><br>
The <i>Rhipidomella nevadensis</i> brachiopod zone is latest Mississippian in
age and extends to the GSSP boundary where it is overlain by the <i>Rugoclostus</i>
zone of early Pennsylvanian age.</p>

<h4>Correlation
Events:</h4>

<p>Conodont FAD <i>Declinognathodus
noduliferus</i></p>
