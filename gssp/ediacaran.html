<h4 style="color:red;">Definition:</h4>

<p style="color:red;">The base of the Ediacaran
System is defined as the base of the Marinoan cap carbonate (Nuccaleena
Formation) in the Enorama Creek Section of the central Flinders Ranges,
Adelaide Rift Complex, South Australia. The principal observed correlation
events are (1) the rapid decay of Marinoan ice sheets and onset of distinct cap
carbonates throughout the world, and (2) the beginning of a distinctive pattern
of secular changes in carbon isotopes.</p>

  <h4>Location:</h4>
  <p>The
  Enorama Creek Section is located in the central Flinders Ranges, Adelaide
  Rift Complex, South Australia at a Latitude of 31°19'53.2&quot;S, and a
  longitude of 138°38'0.2&quot;E.</p>

  <h4>Sedimentology:</h4>
  <p>The
  GSSP is underlain by a varied assemblage of glacial, glacial-marine and
  associated deposits of the Elatina Formation. The lower contact of the
  Nuccaleena Formation is a disconformity, tentatively attributed to
  post-glacial isostatic rebound. The Marinoan cap carbonate is located at the
  base of the Nuccaleena Formation. It is typically no more than a few meters
  thick and is composed primarily of finely laminated cream and pink microspar
  and dolomicrite. It is interpreted to represent a short-lived chemical
  oceanographic event accompanying Marinoan deglaciation and sea-level rise and
  to be of global extent.</p>

<h4>Primary Markers:</h4>

<p>The principal observed correlation
events are (1) the rapid decay of Marinoan ice sheets and onset of distinct cap
carbonates throughout the world, and (2) the beginning of a distinctive pattern
of secular changes in carbon isotopes.</p>

<h4>Correlation
Events:</h4>

<p>(1) rapid decay of Marinoan ice sheets
and onset of distinct cap carbonates throughout the world, and (2) the
beginning of a distinctive pattern of secular changes in carbon isotopes.</p>

<h4>Other Locations
around the World:</h4>

<p>Marinoan-type cap carbonates are
recognized above the Nantou Formation in China, the Blaini Formation in the
lesser Himalayas (India), the Smalfjord Formation in North Norway, the Icebrook
Formation in Canada, the Ghaub Formation in Namibia. The Yudoma Group in
Siberia and the Vendian succession in Ukraine, both begin with a transgression
within the Ediacaran Period.</p>

<h4>Notes on
Derivation of Age:</h4>

<p>Age suggested by Ediacaran Subcomm.;
bracketed by radiometric ages of 600 and 635 Ma</p>
