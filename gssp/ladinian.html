<h3><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:blue'>GSSP
for Ladinian Stage</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
color:red'>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 style="color:red;">Definition:</h4>

<p style="color:red;">The Base of the Ladinian
Stage (Middle Triassic) is defined at the base of a 15 - 20cm thick limestone
bed overlying a distinctive groove (&quot;Chiesense groove&quot;) of limestone
nodules in a shaly matrix, located about 5m above the base of the Buchenstein
Beds in the Caffaro River bed (45°49'09.5&quot;N, 10°28'15.5&quot;E), south of
the village of Bagolino (Province of Brescia, Northern Italy). The lower
surface of the thick limestone bed has the lowest occurrence of the ammonoid <i>Eoprotrachyceras
curionii</i>. Secondary global markers in the uppermost Anisian include the
lowest occurrence of conodont <i>Neogondolella praehungarica</i> and a brief
normal-polarity magnetic zone recognized in closely correlated sections. The
GSSP level is bracketed by U-Pb single zircon age data from volcaniclastic
horizons, indicating a boundary age of ca. 241 Ma.</p>

  <h4>Location:</h4>
  <p>The
  GSSP is located at Bagolino (Province of Brescia, Northern Italy) in the
  eastern Lombardian Alps, in Valle del Caffaro between Val Camonica and Valli
  Giudicarie. The Anisian/Ladinian boundary succession is well exposed at three
  sites (A - C) in the bed of the river Caffaro, in the surroundings of the
  Romanterra Bridge, south of the village of Bagolino. The GSSP Site is situated
  close to the eastern end of Site B and its coordinates are 614.276 / 5075.118
  (UTM-grid) and Long./Lat. 45°49'09.5&quot;N, 10°28'15.5&quot;E respectively. <br>
  The GSSP Site (= Site B) is situated approximately 150m ESE of the Romanterra
  Bridge.</p>

  <h4>Sedimentology:</h4>
  <p>At
  Bagolino, the pelagic succession consists from bottom to top of the Angolino
  Limestone. the Prezzo Limestone, the Buchenstein Beds and the Wengen Beds. <br>
  The Buchenstein Beds consist of siliceous pelagic nodular limestones and up
  to a few decimetres thick volcaniclastic layers which can be traced laterally
  on a regional scale. A marked change in sedimentation is observed at the top
  of the Buchenstein Beds with the abrupt switch to the predominantly
  siliciclastic Wengen Beds.<br>
  The Anisian/Ladinian boundary interval comprises the &quot;transitional
  beds&quot; and the lower part of the Buchenstein Beds and is best exposed at
  Sites A - C. In particular, at the eastern end of Site B the fully exposed
  strata from the 57m-level upward can be traced over several tens of metres
  along strike.<br>
  The GSSP level at Bagolino is defined in the lower part of the Buchenstein
  Beds, around 5m above its base, at the top of a distinct 20-25cm-thick
  interval of limestone nodules in a shaly matrix in contact (upwards) with
  several thick limestone beds.</p>

<h4>Primary Markers:</h4>

<p>The GSSP at Bagolino is located at the
top of a distinct 20-25cm-thick interval of limestone nodules in a shaly
matrix. The Anisian - Ladinian Boundary is defined by the first appearance of
the ammonoid genus <i>Eoprotrachyceras</i>, i.e. with the species <i>Eoprotrachyceras
curionii</i> at the lower surface of the overlying thick limestone bed.</p>

<h4>Secondary
Markers:</h4>

<p><b>Conodonts:</b><br>
The appearance of <i>Neogondolella praehungarica</i> and its co-occurrence with
<i>Paragondolella fueloepi</i> in the upper part of the <i>Neogondolella
secedensis</i> zone, just below the GSSP level, seems at present to be the only
suitable marker for conodont-based correlations.</p>

<h4>Correlation
Events:</h4>

<p>Ammonite FAD <i>Eoprotrachyceras
curionii</i> (base of the <i>E. curionii</i> zone). Conodont FAD <i>Budurovignathus
praehungaricus</i> is in the uppermost Anisian.</p>

<h4>Other Locations
around the World:</h4>

<p>Representatives of the genus <i>Eoprotrachyceras</i>
have been reported from numerous places including the Triassic successions in
North America (Nevada, British Columbia) and <i>Eoprotrachyceras</i> is
therefore a suitable marker for trans-Panthalassan correlation.</p>

<h4>Notes on
Derivation of Age:</h4>

<p>U-Pb
array by Mundil et al. on levels near Nevadites (= Secedensis) ammonite zone in
Dolomites, plus placement relative to magnetostratigraphy correlations to
cycle-scaled Newark magnetic polarity pattern. However, revised correlations
and zircon processing suggest 240.5 Ma <br>
