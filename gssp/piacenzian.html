for Piacenzian Stage</h3>

<h4 style="color:red;">Definition:</h4>

<p style="color:red;">The base of the Piacenzian
Stage is defined as the base of the beige marl bed of the small-scale carbonate
cycle 77. It corresponds to precessional excursion 347 as numbered from the
present, with an astrochronological age estimate of 3.600 Ma. The GSSP is
located in the Punta Piccola section, Italy.</p>

  <h4>Location:</h4>
  <p>The
  Punta Piccola section is located on the southern coast of Sicily (Italy). The
  section is represented on the Carta Topografica d'Italia in the 1:25,000
  series, Foglio 271, Quadrante IV, NO (Porto Empedocle) at a latitude of
  37°17'20&quot; N and a longitude of 13°29'36&quot; E of Greenwich. The
  section is located along the road from Porto Empedocle to Realmonte, 4km to
  the east of Capo Rossello and about 3km to the W-NW of Porto Empedocle.</p>

  <h4>Sedimentology:</h4>
  <p>The
  Punta Piccola section is the upper part of the Rossello Composite Section,
  which is made up by about 100m of alternating marls and limestones of the
  Trubi Formation, transitionally grading upward into the more marly Monte
  Narbonne Formation. The Monte Narbonne Formation is characterized by the
  cyclical occurrence of laminated (sapropelic) layers. The transition from the
  Trubi Formation to the Monte Narbonne Formation occurs in the Punta Piccola
  section at about 20m from its base. The depositional environment for the
  boundary is inferred to be a slope-basin setting with water depth ranging
  from 800 to 1000m.</p>

<h4>Primary Markers:</h4>

<p><b>Astrocyclostratigraphy</b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>:<br>
The base of the Piacenzian Stage is defined as the base of the beige marl bed
of the small-scale carbonate cycle 77. It corresponds to precessional excursion
347 as numbered from the present, with an astrochronological age estimate of
3.600Ma.<br>
<b>Paleomagnetics:</b><br>
The section spans the interval from the upper part of the Gilbert Chron (C2Ar)
through the entire Gauss Chron and to the lowermost part of the Matuyama Chron.
The Gilbert-Gauss magnetic reversal is recorded immediately above the GSSP
within the same precessional cycle, having an astrochronological age of
3.596Ma.</p>

<h4>Secondary
Markers:</h4>

<p><b>Foraminifera:</b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'><br>
In the Mediterranean the base of the Piacenzian can be recognized by the first
influx of <i>Globorotalia crassaformis</i> (3.60 Ma) and by the temporary
disappearance of <i>Globorotalia puncticulata</i> (3.57 Ma). In low and
mid-latitude areas outside of the Mediterranean the last occurrence of <i>Globorotalia
margeritae</i> (3.58 Ma) and <i>Pulleniatina primalis</i> (3.65) are close to
the boundary.</p>

<h4>Correlation
Events:</h4>

<p>Magnetic -- Gauss/Gilbert (C2An/C2Ar)
magnetic reversal is recorded immediately above the GSSP</p>

Derivation of Age:</h4>
