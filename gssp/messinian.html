<h3><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:blue'>GSSP
for Messinian Stage</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";

<h4 style="color:red;">Definition:</h4>

<p style="color:red;">The base of the Messinian
stage is defined at the base of the reddish layer of sedimentary cycle no. 15
at Oued Akrech, Morocco, NW Africa. This point coincides closely with the first
regular occurrence of the planktonic foraminifer <i>Globorotalia miotumida</i>
and the first occurrence of the calcareous nannofossil <i>Amaurolithus
delicatus</i>, and falls within the interval of reversed polarity that
corresponds to C3Br.1r. The base of the reddish layer and, thus, the Messinian
GSSP has been assigned an astronomical age of 7.251Ma, later revised to 7.246.</p>

  <h4>Location:</h4>
  <p>The
  Oued Akrech is located 7km SSE of Rabat in a road-cut along a steep bluff
  next to the Oued Akrech (&quot;oued&quot; = &quot;wadi&quot; = valley), at a
  latitude: 33°56'13&quot; north, and a longitude: 6°48'45&quot; west. The
  exposure is along the narrow road that connects the P22 from Rabat (direction
  Rommani) and the S203, about 3km from the junction with the P22. Oued Akrech
  is a tributary of the Bou Regreg River that forms a deep valley in southward
  direction as the river turns to the east (topographic map NI-29-XII-3C,
  coordinates 370.2-370 to 371).</p>

  <h4>Sedimentology:</h4>
  <p>The
  Oued Akrech section consists of deep marine marls known as Blue marls after
  their distinct fresh color. The weathered color of these marls at Oued
  Akrech, however, is a yellow-beige with reddish color bands (color cycles).
  The Blue Marls were deposited in the Gharb Basin which represents the
  westward extension - and opening to the Atlantic - of the Rifian Corridor.
  The corridor acted as an extensional foredeep during the late Miocene to
  early Pliocene.</p>

<h4>Primary Markers:</h4>

<p>The basic sedimentary cycles are
precession-controlled but precession/obliquity interference patterns are
present as well. The characteristic cycle pattern allows the section to be
astronomically tuned by matching the color cycles to correlative patterns in
the astronomical target curve (Hilgen et al., 2000a; 65° N lat. summer
insolation), thereby providing highly accurate ages for the Tortonian/Messinian
boundary. The base of the reddish layer and, thus, the Messinian GSSP has been
assigned an astronomical age of 7.251Ma, later revised to 7.246.</p>

<h4>Secondary
Markers:</h4>

<p><b>Foraminifera:</b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'><br>
The turnover of dominantly dextrally coiled assemblages of <i>Globorotalia
menardii</i> by dominantly sinistrally coiled assemblages of the <i>Globorotalia
miotumida</i> group can be used to recognize the Tortonian/Messinian boundary
in the Mediterranean and adjacent North Atlantic.<br>
<b>Nannoplankton</b><br>
The first occurrence of <i>Amaurolithus primus</i> and <i>Amaurolithus
delicatus</i> predate the boundary, while the first occurrence of <i>Amaurolithus
amplificus</i> s.s. postdates the boundary. The first common occurrence of <i>Reticulofenestra
rotaria</i> also predates the boundary.<br>
<b>Paleomagnetics:</b><br>
The recorded two normal polarity intervals and intervening reversed interval
correspond - from bottom to top - to C3Br.1n, C3Br.1r and C3Bn.</p>

<h4>Correlation
Events:</h4>

<p>Planktonic foraminifer first regular
occurrence of <i>Globorotalia miotumida</i>, and calcareous nannofossil FAD <i>Amaurolithus
delicatus</i></p>

Derivation of Age:</h4>
