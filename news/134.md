## Coniacian Stage and subseries/subepoch unit divisions ratified

It is a great pleasure to inform you all that two proposals, the definition of Coniacian Stage GSSP and the formal adoption of chronostratigraphical/geochronological unit divisions subseries/subepoch within the International Stratigraphic Guide were unanimously ratified by the IUGS Executive in early May, 2021.
