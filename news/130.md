        Interactive Chart (2020-01)

We are pleased to announce a new, interactive, version of the International Chronostratigraphic Chart! Students and staff
at the [Geological Survey of Queensland](https://www.business.qld.gov.au/industries/mining-energy-water/resources/geoscience-information/gsq) 
and the [CSIRO](https://www.csiro.au) have produced this version of the chart which uses data from its 
[Semantic Web](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/) representation. This allows users to click on parts of the chart to 
return information in a user-friendly operation. Links in the returned page can be further followed to other parts of the chart.

The chart can be re-scaled using time, scaled as per the static chart, or logarithmic and even linear time. This aids
in comparing the relative lengths of the time periods.

You can easily host a copy of this interactive chart online elsewhere, just visit the the underlying 
[code repository](https://github.com/CSIRO-enviro-informatics/interactive-geological-timescale) for details.
