We are please to announce a new, interactive, version of the International Chronostratigraphic Chart! Students and staff
at the [Geological Survey of Queensland](https://www.business.qld.gov.au/industries/mining-energy-water/resources/geoscience-information/gsq) 
and the [CSIRO](https://www.csiro.au) have produced this version of the chart uses data from its 
[Semantic Web](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/) representation. This allow clicks on parts of the chart to 
return data. Links in the returned page can be further followed to other parts of the chart.

The chart can be re-scaled using time, scaled as per the static chart, or logarithmic and even linear time. This aids
in comparing the relative lengths of the time periods.

You can easily host a copy of this interactive chart online elsewhere, just visit the the underlying 
[code repository](https://github.com/CSIRO-enviro-informatics/interactive-geological-timescale) for details.
