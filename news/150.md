## 2023/06 International Chronostratigraphic chart

The International Commission on Stratigraphy is delighted to announce publication of the 2023/06 International Chronostratigraphic chart. Key is the addition of the ratified Golden Spike for the base of the Langhian Stage and the base of the Middle Miocene Subseries. This horizon is currently dated at 15.98 Ma.

We thank the many stratigraphers worldwide for their exceptional efforts in developing the chart and the global language for geologists and others working with geological time at all scales.
