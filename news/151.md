## Silurian Telychian and Aeronian stage GSSPs have been relocated

### Telychian

The proposal for a revised GSSP for the base of the Telychian Stage of the Llandovery Series and Silurian System as approved by the International Commission on Stratigraphy and forwarded to the IUGS EC on 9 January 2024. 

The Telychian Stage/Age Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) from the current GSSP in the Cefn Cerig section, near Llandovery in Wales, UK.  The Global Boundary and Stratotype Section and Point for the base of the Telychian Stage, is the FAD of the graptolite _Spirograptus guerichi_, 0.25 m below a rusty weathering layer and 0.6 m above a layer of nodules in the El Pintado 1 section within the Valle Syncline in the northern part of Seville Province, Spain. Commencement of increased _Streptograptus_ diversity, including the FAD of _Streptograptus picarrai_, is a secondary marker of the base of the Telychian, together with the 'Rumba low' negative δ13Corg excursion culminating 1.4–1.6 m higher in the section. 

### Aeronian

The IUGS Executive Committee has voted unanimously to ratify the proposal for a revised GSSP for the base of the Aeronian Stage of the Llandovery Series and Silurian System as approved by the International Commission on Stratigraphy and forwarded to the IUGS EC on 9 January 2024. 

The resiting of the Aeronian Stage/Age Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) from the current GSSP in the Trefawr Track section, Wales, UK, for approval by ICS.  The Global Boundary and Stratotype Section and Point for the base of the Aeronian Stage of the Silurian System is proposed at 1.38 m above the base of the black shale succession of the Želkovice Formation in the Hlásná Třebaň section in central Bohemia, in the Czech Republic.
