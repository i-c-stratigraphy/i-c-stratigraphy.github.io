<h2>Formal subdivision of the Holocene Series/Epoch </h2>

<p>It is a pleasure to announce that the proposals for the subdivision of the Holocene Series/Epoch into three stages/ages and their corresponding subseries/subepochs by the International Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy (ISQS) (a subcommission of the International Commission on Stratigraphy - ICS) have been ratified unanimously by the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS). The subdivisions are now formally defined as follows:</p>

<h4>1. Greenlandian Stage/Age = Lower/Early Holocene Subseries/Subepoch</h4>
<p>Boundary Stratotype (GSSP): NorthGRIP2 ice core, Greenland (coincident with the Holocene Series/Epoch GSSP, ratified 2008). Age: 11,700 yr b2k (before AD 2000).</p>

<h4>2. Northgrippian Stage/Age = Middle/Mid-Holocene Subseries/Subepoch</h4>
<p>Boundary Stratotype (GSSP): NorthGRIP1 ice core, Greenland. Global AuxiliaryStratotype: Gruta do Padre Cave speleothem, Brazil. Age: 8326 yr b2k.</p>

<h4>3. Meghalayan Stage/Age = Upper/Late Holocene Subseries/Subepoch</h4>
<p>Boundary stratotype (GSSP): Mawmluh Cave speleothem, Meghalaya, India. Global Auxiliary Stratotype, Mount Logan ice core, Canada. Age: 4250 yr b2k.</p>

<p>These divisions are now each defined by Global Stratotype Sections and Points (GSSPs) which means that the divisions are fixed in time in sedimentary sequences. The terms Greenlandian Stage/Age , Northgrippian Stage/Age, Meghalayan Stage/Age, Lower/Early Holocene Subseries/Subepoch, Middle/Mid-Holocene Subseries/Subepoch and Late/Upper Holocene Subseries/Subepoch therefore have formal definitions and boundaries (note formal stratigraphical terms must have capitalised first letters). If the terms are used informally, lower-case first letters should be used (except for Holocene) â€“ editors please note!</p>

<p>These definitions represent the first formal geological subdivision of the Holocene Series/Epoch and are the result of over a decade of labour by members of the joint ISQS INTIMATE Members Working Group (Integration of Ice-core, Marine and Terrestrial Records) and the International Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy, led by Professor Mike Walker. To these colleagues we owe a great debt of thanks. Formal publication of the justifications and definitions of each of the divisions will follow.</p>
