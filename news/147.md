Are you looking for a stratigraphy book to help your colleagues or PhD students with their research, for advanced stratigraphy classes or maybe some more information on the advantages and pitfalls of a technique that is outside of your specialist area? If so you might be interested in this new title:  _Deciphering Earthâ€™s History: the Practice of Stratigraphy_ written by a team of 40 stratigraphers. The book takes a step-by-step approach to guide the reader through the key stratigraphy tools. There are flow charts, top tips, worked examples and lots of illustrations.
