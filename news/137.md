## The Neogene Subseries/Subepochs are Formal Chronostratigraphic Units

The [Subcommission of Neogene Stratigraphy (SNS)](https://neogene.stratigraphy.org/) is pleased to announce the ratification by the [Executive Committee of the IUGS](https://www.iugs.org/executive) on 13 October 2021 of its proposal for formalization of the Neogene Subseries/Subepochs. This follows the ratification by the same committee on 1 May 2021 of a proposal by the International Commission on Stratigraphic Classification (ISSC) to recognize the rank of Subseries/Subepoch as formal and to be integrated in the International Chronostratigraphic Chart (ICC). 

The vote for formal Neogene Subseries/Subepochs, initiated on 20 May 2021, gave rise to a healthy discussion in which virtually all members of the SNS participated, followed by a vote in which 81.25% of the members voted for formalization. In addition to the insertion of the Neogene Subseries/Subepochs in the ICC, every interested party should inform colleagues, students, authors, editors  and publishers of the new formal status of the Neogene Subseries/Subepochs.
