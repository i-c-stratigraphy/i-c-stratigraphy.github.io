## The Kimmeridgian GSSP has been ratified by IUGS

The International Commission on Stratigraphy are pleased to announce that the the Kimmeridgian GSSP, identifying the base of the middle stage of the Upper Jurassic Series within the Jurassic System, has been formally ratified by the [International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS)](https://www.iugs.org/).

The Kimmeridgian Stage is named after the town of Kimmeridge which is part of the _Jurassic Coast_, a World Heritage Site on the English Channel coast of southern England. It stretches from Exmouth in East Devon to Studland Bay in Dorset, a distance of about 150km, and was inscribed on the World Heritage List in mid-December 2001 due to the fossilised remains of the various creatures that lived here have been preserved in the Jurassic-age rocks.

The Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point - GSSP - that marks the basal stratum of the Kimmeridgian Stage is defined by the Subboreal _baylei_ ammonite Zone in the Staffin Bay section on the Isle of Skye, Scotland, UK.
