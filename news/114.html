<h2>Revised ICS Statutes ratified by IUGS EC</h2>

<p>The revised ICS statutes have been approved by ICS on 24 March 2017 and ratified by the IUGS Executive Committee on 25 April 2017. These statutes are based upon but also significantly revised from those approved by ICS on 28 August 2001, and accepted with minor modifications by IUGS in February 2002, which, in turn, supersede the statutes accepted by IUGS at its annual meeting, 15-18 January 1997.</p>
